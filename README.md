# IoT-based-Tracking-System-for-Emergency-Help
This project addresses the problem, “How can we ensure safety of an individual in an unforeseen vulnerable situation in the most efficient and reliable way?”. The system aims to minimize the lingering threat and to assure you of your personal safety using IoT. A lightweight, stand-alone device is created that can be added to your shoes. This device will continuously send your current GPS coordinates to a remote server every minute. It will consume very less data (some MBs in a month) and will have a battery life of about 80 hours or more than a week. In times of danger, the device can be triggered either manually or automatically.
